Below is a structured plan that you could give to your developer to transition from the old approach—where the entire database is included in the prompt—to the new approach, which uses OpenAI function calls to retrieve data on-demand. Once you have a working plan, you can then update your prompt to reflect this new approach.

---

### High-Level Changes

1. **Stop Passing Full Database Context:**
   Remove the logic that serializes and includes the entire user context (all tasks, people, notes, topics) into the prompt at every request.

2. **Introduce Function Calling:**
   Define a set of OpenAI “functions” representing the various retrieval operations you currently do with the database. For example:
   - `get_people(name: string) -> Person[]`
   - `get_tasks(query: string) -> Task[]`
   - `get_topics(keyword: string) -> Topic[]`
   - `get_notes(query: string) -> Note[]`

   These functions will not be called directly by the developer. Instead, they’re exposed to the model, and the model decides when to call them. When the model calls a function, you will see that in the OpenAI response, and your code will execute the corresponding database query and return the results to the model.

3. **Conversation Loop for Data Retrieval:**
   The interaction with OpenAI is now iterative:
   - Send user’s request + system/dev instructions + conversation history to OpenAI along with the function schemas.
   - If OpenAI responds with a function call:
     - Parse the function call name and arguments.
     - Execute the appropriate backend query (no entire DB dump, just targeted queries).
     - Return the results to OpenAI as a “function” role message containing the JSON with retrieved entities.
   - OpenAI may then call another function or provide a user-facing message. Continue this loop until OpenAI signals it has enough info (e.g., it moves from Stage 1 to Stage 2).

4. **Stage 1 (Context Gathering) vs Stage 2 (Final Extraction):**
   In Stage 1, the model may repeatedly call functions to gather information. You will:
   - Keep track of all conversation turns, including user messages, model responses, and function calls/returns.
   - Continue feeding the entire conversation history (including all function calls and returns) into each new OpenAI request.

   Once the model says “status: complete,” it means it has finished context gathering. You then proceed to Stage 2 where the final entities are processed or updated in your database.

5. **Update Your Internal Workflow:**
   - **Before sending to OpenAI:**
     Include messages:
     - System and Developer instructions (no large DB dump)
     - The full conversation history so far (including any previously fetched data)
     - The user’s latest message
     - The function definitions (schema) that OpenAI can call
   - **Check OpenAI’s response:**
     If the response has `"name": "<function_name>"`, it means you need to call that function. Execute the query against your DB and return results to OpenAI as a function role message.
     If the response is a user-facing message, check `status` in the instructions. If `incomplete`, continue. If `complete`, proceed to Stage 2 finalization.

6. **Conversation History and Continuity:**
   To preserve continuity:
   - Store all messages (user, assistant, function calls, function returns) in the thread’s history.
   - On each new request to OpenAI, send this entire history along with the function definitions. This allows the model to “remember” what was previously fetched and decided.

   Since you are not passing the entire DB now, the prompt will remain smaller, only growing with relevant conversation and function calls.

7. **No Need for Full Context in the Prompt Construction:**
   Remove `get_user_context` calls and do not pass serialized large data sets. Instead, rely on function calls to fetch data as needed. The `construct_prompt` method becomes simpler:
   - Just include system/developer messages,
   - The entire conversation so far,
   - The user’s current input,
   - The function definitions.

8. **When Ready to Finalize (Stage 2):**
   Once the model gives a “complete” status with final entities:
   - Extract these entities from the final OpenAI response.
   - Apply the database changes (create/update/delete) as described.
   - Return the final result to the user.

### Actionable Steps for the Developer

1. **Refactor Prompt Construction:**
   - Remove code that appends the entire user context (entities) into the prompt.
   - Instead, at the start of each request, send only system/dev prompts, conversation history, user message, and function schemas.

2. **Add Function Schemas to the Prompt:**
   - Define JSON schema for each function (like `get_people` or `get_tasks`) and add them to the OpenAI call via `functions` parameter.
   - Initially, these functions are just a contract the model can use. Your code will need to handle function calls when they appear in the response.

3. **Handle Function Calls in a Loop:**
   - After calling OpenAI, check if the response includes a `function_call`.
   - If yes, parse the function call name and arguments.
   - Execute the corresponding database call to fetch or filter entities.
   - Send a new message to OpenAI with `role: "function"` and the returned JSON data from the DB query.
   - Loop this until the model returns a regular message without `function_call` or the `status` changes to “complete.”

4. **Store and Resend History:**
   - Each time you get a response (user message, function call, function result, assistant message), add it to the thread history in the database.
   - When making the next call to OpenAI, include all previous messages (both user and assistant, plus function calls and returns) so continuity is maintained.

5. **Implement Conditional Stage Logic:**
   - If `status` == “incomplete”, remain in Stage 1 and keep handling function calls or clarifications.
   - If `status` == “complete”, proceed to Stage 2. Use the data from the final response to update your DB (create or update tasks, people, etc.) as per the extracted entities. Then respond to the user with the final result.

### Summary

- **Before:** Passing full DB to OpenAI upfront.
- **After:** Define functions, let OpenAI call them when needed. On each function call, run DB queries and return only relevant data. Keep the conversation and function interactions in the thread history, and resend them each time.

This approach reduces prompt size, improves scalability, and cleanly separates data retrieval from the conversation logic.
