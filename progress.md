# Project Progress

## Current activity

[Testing] Expand test coverage:

1. Updated and expanded tests in `test_middleware.py` to cover various scenarios for the `RateLimitInfoMiddleware`.
2. Enhanced `test_sidekick.py` with comprehensive tests for the Sidekick service, including CRUD operations for topics, tasks, people, and notes.
3. Implemented tests for error handling and edge cases in Sidekick service.
4. Added tests for concurrent entity updates and thread management.

[API Enhancement] Implement new endpoints for Sidekick service:

1. Added new endpoints for topics, tasks, people, and notes under the `/api/v1/sidekick` prefix.
2. Updated the main Sidekick endpoint to `/api/v1/sidekick/ask`.
3. Implemented proper error handling and logging for all new endpoints.
4. Updated Pydantic models in `sidekick_schema.py` to support new endpoints.
5. Modified `operations.py` to support CRUD operations for all entity types.

## Completed

1. Implemented rate limiting middleware.
2. Added rate limit information to API responses.
3. Created comprehensive tests for rate limiting in `test_rate_limiting.py`.
4. Enhanced Sidekick service with new CRUD endpoints for topics, tasks, people, and notes.
5. Implemented pagination for list endpoints to improve performance with large datasets.
6. Updated database operations to support new API functionality.
7. Improved type hinting and error handling across the application.
8. Consolidated API routing in `main.py` for better organization.

## Next Steps

1. [Security] Complete rate limiting implementation:
   - Review and adjust rate limits for all relevant API endpoints.
   - Ensure rate limiting is working correctly in production environment.

2. [Documentation] Update API documentation:
   - Update OpenAPI/Swagger documentation to reflect new endpoints and rate limiting.
   - Add examples and descriptions for new request/response models.
   - Update any existing API documentation or README files.

3. [Performance] Optimize database queries:
   - Review and optimize database queries, especially for file operations and entity relationships.
   - Implement database indexing where necessary.
   - Consider using database-specific optimizations (e.g., PostgreSQL-specific features).

4. [Reliability] Implement rollback and monitoring strategies:
   - Design and implement a rollback mechanism for database operations.
   - Set up application monitoring (e.g., using Prometheus and Grafana).
   - Implement health checks and alerts for critical system components.

5. [Maintainability] Implement database migrations for easier schema management:
   - Set up Alembic for database migrations.
   - Create initial migration based on current schema.
   - Document migration process for future schema changes.

## Pick up next (High Priority)

Based on the current status, the next high-priority task to be picked up should be:

[Documentation] Update API documentation:

1. Review and update OpenAPI/Swagger documentation to reflect all new endpoints, including the Sidekick service endpoints.
2. Add detailed descriptions and examples for new request/response models, especially for the Sidekick service.
3. Update the API documentation to include information about rate limiting, including the headers used and how to handle rate limit errors.
4. Create or update a separate API documentation file (e.g., API.md) with comprehensive information about all endpoints, their usage, and any specific considerations.
5. Update the main README.md file to reflect recent changes and point to the detailed API documentation.

This task is crucial as it ensures that all the recent changes and additions to the API are properly documented, making it easier for developers (including yourself) to understand and use the API correctly.
