## In Progress
- [ ] Set up Docker and Kamal configuration for deployment
- [ ] Add more logging statements throughout the application for better debugging and monitoring
- [ ] Expand test coverage, especially for WebSocket and file operations

## To Do
- [ ] Debug and fix WebSocket broadcast test
- [ ] Implement rollback and monitoring strategies
- [ ] Enhance documentation
- [ ] Implement data isolation strategy for chambers
- [ ] Design and implement offline message queueing
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse
- [ ] Implement database migrations for easier schema management
- [ ] Add API versioning to make future updates easier

## Issues and Improvements
- [ ] Investigate and resolve issues with WebSocket broadcast functionality
- [ ] Consider implementing a more robust WebSocket connection management system
- [ ] Evaluate and improve the current authentication mechanism for scalability
- [ ] Implement a more comprehensive error handling and reporting system
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests to cover end-to-end scenarios
- [ ] Optimize database queries for better performance, especially for file operations
- [ ] Implement a caching strategy to reduce database load for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Consider implementing a background task queue for handling long-running operations
