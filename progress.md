# Project Progress

## Completed
- [x] Basic FastAPI application structure
- [x] Health check endpoint
- [x] Authentication router (implemented)
- [x] WebSocket support
- [x] Database abstraction with SQLAlchemy
- [x] Redis caching setup
- [x] Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration
- [x] Structured logging
- [x] Error handling middleware
- [x] Secure URL generation and secret code mechanism
- [x] Basic testing framework
- [x] Implement simplified user registration and authentication flow
- [x] Develop additional data models and schemas
- [x] Implement CRUD operations for main entities
- [x] Enhance WebSocket functionality for real-time updates
- [x] Implement MinIO integration for object storage
- [x] Complete implementation of `authenticate_user` and `get_current_user` functions in `routers/auth.py`
- [x] Wrap Minio client in a custom class implementing the `StorageService` interface in `app/dependencies.py`
- [x] Replace `print` statements with proper logging in `app/services/storage_service.py`
- [x] Consolidate configuration files: remove `config.py` and use `app/core/config.py` throughout the application
- [x] Consolidate `User` model definitions in `app/models.py` and remove `models` folder
- [x] Implement proper error handling and validation in file upload and retrieval endpoints in `app/routers/files.py`
- [x] Add authentication to the WebSocket endpoint
- [x] Implement file listing logic in the `list_files` endpoint in `app/routers/files.py`
- [x] Add more comprehensive test coverage in `tests/test_main.py`
- [x] Ensure all sensitive information (like `SECRET_KEY`) is properly secured and not hardcoded in configuration files
- [x] Update WebSocket tests in `/tests/test_websocket.py` to use `TestClient` from `fastapi.testclient`
- [x] Fix database initialization issues in WebSocket tests
- [x] Implement more comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Review and update all file paths to use absolute paths from project root

## In Progress
- [ ] Set up Docker and Kamal configuration for deployment
- [ ] Implement `WebSocketManager` from `/app/services/websocket_manager.py` in the main application (`/app/app.py`)
- [ ] Replace stub implementation of `StorageService` in `/app/dependencies.py` with a real implementation (e.g., using MinIO)
- [ ] Expand test coverage, especially for WebSocket and file operations
- [ ] Add more logging statements throughout the application for better debugging and monitoring

## To Do
- [ ] Implement rollback and monitoring strategies
- [ ] Enhance documentation
- [ ] Implement data isolation strategy for chambers
- [ ] Design and implement offline message queueing
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse
- [ ] Implement database migrations for easier schema management
- [ ] Add API versioning to make future updates easier

## Issues and Improvements
- [ ] Consider implementing a more robust WebSocket connection management system
- [ ] Evaluate and improve the current authentication mechanism for scalability
- [ ] Implement a more comprehensive error handling and reporting system
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests to cover end-to-end scenarios
- [ ] Optimize database queries for better performance, especially for file operations
- [ ] Implement a caching strategy to reduce database load for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Consider implementing a background task queue for handling long-running operations
