# Project Progress

## Current activity

[Deployment] Implement Docker & Kamal deployment:

1. Review and enhance the Kamal configuration (config/deploy.yml): (Completed)
2. Review and enhance secret management in Kamal: (Completed)
3. Update application configuration for different environments: (Completed)
4. Create setup.md with detailed deployment instructions: (Completed)
5. Fix configuration issues in test environment: (Completed)
6. Update database driver to support async operations: (Completed)
7. Test the Kamal deployment process:
   - Set up a staging environment to test the Kamal deployment
   - Document the deployment process for both staging and production
8. Update documentation:
   - Add instructions for using Docker and docker-compose for local development
   - Document the Kamal deployment process for staging and production

### Completed

1. Ensure robust input validation using Pydantic models for all API endpoints.
2. Setup consistent logging configuration for the entire application, and have centralized management (log levels, formatting, integrations etc.).
3. Expand test coverage, especially for dependencies.py, auth.py and websocket.py
4. Simplifying Code Structure
5. Cleaning up Logs/Error Handling
6. Implement proper logging throughout the application
7. Create Dockerfile for the application
8. Set up docker-compose for local development
9. Review and enhance the Kamal configuration (config/deploy.yml)
10. Review and enhance secret management in Kamal
11. Update application configuration for different environments
12. Create setup.md with detailed deployment instructions
13. Fix configuration issues in test environment
14. Update database driver to support async operations

## Recent Improvements

1. Enhanced Pydantic validations across all modules
2. Improved error handling with more specific exceptions and error messages
3. Implemented comprehensive logging throughout the application
4. Added detailed inline documentation for all functions and classes
5. Updated and expanded test coverage, including mock services for testing
6. Refactored dependencies and services for better modularity and testability

## Pick up next (High Priority)

- [Security] Add rate limiting for API endpoints:
  - Implement rate limiting middleware
  - Configure rate limits for different API endpoints
  - Add rate limit information to API responses

- [Reliability] Implement rollback and monitoring strategies:
  - Design and implement a rollback mechanism for database operations
  - Set up application monitoring (e.g., using Prometheus and Grafana)
  - Implement health checks and alerts for critical system components

## To Do (Medium Priority)

- [Functional] Design and implement offline message queueing:
  - Choose a message queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis Pub/Sub)
  - Implement a queueing mechanism for offline users
  - Design a process to deliver queued messages when users come online

- [Maintainability] Enhance documentation:
  - Create comprehensive API documentation using FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI
  - Write a detailed README.md file explaining project setup, configuration, and usage
  - Document deployment processes and requirements

- [Maintainability] Implement database migrations for easier schema management:
  - Set up Alembic for database migrations
  - Create initial migration based on current schema
  - Document migration process for future schema changes

- [Maintainability] Add API versioning to make future updates easier:
  - Implement API versioning strategy
  - Update router structure to accommodate versioning
  - Update client-side code to use versioned endpoints

## Future Improvements (Low Priority)

- [Quality] Consider adding integration tests to cover end-to-end scenarios:
  - Design integration test scenarios
  - Implement integration tests using appropriate testing framework
  - Set up CI/CD pipeline to run integration tests

- [Performance] Optimize database queries for better performance, especially for file operations:
  - Analyze and optimize existing database queries
  - Implement database indexing where necessary
  - Consider using database-specific optimizations (e.g., PostgreSQL-specific features)

- [Performance] Implement a caching strategy to reduce database load for frequently accessed data:
  - Choose appropriate caching solution (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
  - Identify data suitable for caching
  - Implement caching logic in relevant parts of the application

- [Scalability] Consider implementing a background task queue for handling long-running operations:
  - Choose a task queue system (e.g., Celery, RQ)
  - Identify operations suitable for background processing
  - Implement background tasks and integrate with the main application

These next steps will further improve the robustness, scalability, and maintainability of your application. Focus on the high-priority items first, then move on to medium and low priority tasks as time and resources allow.
