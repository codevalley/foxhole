14. Update database driver to support async operations
15. Implement rate limiting middleware
16. Add rate limit information to API responses

## Recent Improvements

1. Enhanced Pydantic validations across all modules
2. Improved error handling with more specific exceptions and error messages
3. Implemented comprehensive logging throughout the application
4. Added detailed inline documentation for all functions and classes
5. Updated and expanded test coverage, including mock services for testing
6. Refactored dependencies and services for better modularity and testability
7. Implemented rate limiting for API endpoints using slowapi and Redis

## Pick up next (High Priority)

- [Security] Complete rate limiting implementation:
  - Configure rate limits for all relevant API endpoints
  - Update and expand test cases for rate limiting
  - Update documentation to reflect rate limiting changes

- [Reliability] Implement rollback and monitoring strategies:
  - Design and implement a rollback mechanism for database operations
  - Set up application monitoring (e.g., using Prometheus and Grafana)
  - Implement health checks and alerts for critical system components

## To Do (Medium Priority)

- [Functional] Design and implement offline message queueing:
  - Choose a message queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis Pub/Sub)
  - Implement a queueing mechanism for offline users
  - Design a process to deliver queued messages when users come online

- [Maintainability] Enhance documentation:
  - Create comprehensive API documentation using FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI
  - Write a detailed README.md file explaining project setup, configuration, and usage
  - Document deployment processes and requirements

- [Maintainability] Implement database migrations for easier schema management:
  - Set up Alembic for database migrations
  - Create initial migration based on current schema
  - Document migration process for future schema changes

- [Maintainability] Add API versioning to make future updates easier:
  - Implement API versioning strategy
  - Update router structure to accommodate versioning
  - Update client-side code to use versioned endpoints

## Future Improvements (Low Priority)

- [Quality] Consider adding integration tests to cover end-to-end scenarios:
  - Design integration test scenarios
  - Implement integration tests using appropriate testing framework
  - Set up CI/CD pipeline to run integration tests

- [Performance] Optimize database queries for better performance, especially for file operations:
  - Analyze and optimize existing database queries
  - Implement database indexing where necessary
  - Consider using database-specific optimizations (e.g., PostgreSQL-specific features)

- [Performance] Implement a caching strategy to reduce database load for frequently accessed data:
  - Choose appropriate caching solution (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
  - Identify data suitable for caching
  - Implement caching logic in relevant parts of the application

- [Scalability] Consider implementing a background task queue for handling long-running operations:
  - Choose a task queue system (e.g., Celery, RQ)
  - Identify operations suitable for background processing
  - Implement background tasks and integrate with the main application

These next steps will further improve the robustness, scalability, and maintainability of your application. Focus on the high-priority items first, then move on to medium and low priority tasks as time and resources allow.

## Current activity

[API Enhancement] Implement new endpoints for Sidekick service:

1. Added new endpoints for topics, tasks, people, and notes under the `/api/v1/sidekick` prefix:
   - GET `/topics`: List topics (with pagination)
   - POST `/topics`: Create a new topic
   - PUT `/topics/{topic_id}`: Update an existing topic
   - DELETE `/topics/{topic_id}`: Delete a topic
   - Similar endpoints for tasks, people, and notes
2. Updated the main Sidekick endpoint to `/api/v1/sidekick/ask`
3. Implemented proper error handling and logging for all new endpoints
4. Updated Pydantic models in `sidekick_schema.py` to support new endpoints
5. Modified `operations.py` to support CRUD operations for all entity types
6. Updated `main.py` to include the new Sidekick router with the correct prefix

[Testing] Expand test coverage:

1. Need to add new tests to cover the newly added endpoints:
   - Test CRUD operations for topics, tasks, people, and notes
   - Test pagination functionality
   - Test error handling for invalid inputs or non-existent resources
2. Update existing tests to reflect changes in API structure and responses
3. Ensure all new functions in `operations.py` are covered by unit tests
4. Add integration tests to verify the entire flow from API request to database operation

[Documentation] Update API documentation:

1. Update OpenAPI/Swagger documentation to reflect new endpoints
2. Add examples and descriptions for new request/response models
3. Update any existing API documentation or README files

[Code Quality] Address type hinting and linting issues:

1. Resolved type hinting issues in `sidekick.py` for return types
2. Need to review and fix any remaining type hinting issues in other files
3. Run and fix any new linting errors introduced by recent changes

## Next Steps

1. Implement the new tests as mentioned above
2. Review and update rate limiting for new endpoints
3. Perform thorough manual testing of all new endpoints
4. Update client-side code (if any) to use the new API structure
5. Consider implementing API versioning strategy for future updates

## Recent Improvements

1. Enhanced Sidekick service with new CRUD endpoints for topics, tasks, people, and notes
2. Implemented pagination for list endpoints to improve performance with large datasets
3. Updated database operations to support new API functionality
4. Improved type hinting and error handling across the application
5. Consolidated API routing in `main.py` for better organization
